## The Challenge

The rapid proliferation of Artificial Intelligence has created uncertainty regarding the future of work. We aimed to quantify the impact of AI adoption on labour markets, specifically focusing on skill demand shifts across technology, manufacturing, and service sectors.

## Our Approach

We conducted a comprehensive review of over 40 distinct sources to synthesize evidence on AI adoption trends. 

To go beyond qualitative analysis, we executed **regression-based predictive modeling** using secondary data. This allowed us to:
- Quantify the relationship between AI investment levels and displacement rates.
- Identify specific skill clusters that are becoming obsolete vs. those in high demand.
- Forecast near-term shifts in the North American labour market.

## The Outcome

Our model demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between AI adoption and the polarization of skill demand. We provided structured recommendations for workforce upskilling, highlighting the urgent need for "human-centric" skills that complement AI capabilities rather than competing with them.
