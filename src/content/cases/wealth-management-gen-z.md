## The Challenge

Traditional wealth management services struggle to engage Gen Z investors, who prioritize accessibility, transparency, and values-aligned investing. The RBC InvestEase team sought a strategy to bridge this gap and capture the next generation of investors.

## Our Approach

We conducted in-depth market research to understand the behavioral drivers of Gen Z financial decision-making. Our analysis revealed three key pillars for engagement:

- **Gamification & Education:** integrating learning modules directly into the investment flow.
- **Social Proof:** Leveraging community features to build trust and normalize long-term investing.
- **Low Barriers to Entry:** Simplified onboarding and fractional investing capabilities.

## The Outcome

Our team placed first out of four competing groups. We were selected to present our detailed product roadmap and marketing strategy directly to the RBC InvestEase leadership team. The proposal was recognized for its actionable insights and alignment with broader digital transformation goals.
