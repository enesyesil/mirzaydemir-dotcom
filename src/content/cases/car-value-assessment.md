excerpt: "A decision model designed to answer: 'Which car is the better financial decision over time?' It compares present value by modeling depreciation, maintenance, insurance costs, and inflation-discounted cash flows."
finding: "Built a robust methodology to quantify long-term ownership costs beyond simple sticker price comparisons."

## The Challenge

Car buyers often make decisions based on sticker price and monthly payments, ignoring the Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) over time. We wanted to build a tool that reveals the *true* financial impact of a vehicle purchase, accounting for the time value of money.

## Our Approach

We built a comprehensive Excel-based assessment model that compares the **Net Present Value (NPV)** of ownership for different vehicles. Key variables included:

- **Depreciation Curves:** Modeled based on historical make/model data.
- **Maintenance Schedules:** Projecting costs for critical service intervals (brakes, tires, major fluids).
- **Insurance Premiums:** Estimated based on driver profile and vehicle risk group.
- **Inflation & Discounting:** Adjusting future cash flows to today's dollars to enable fair comparison.

## The Outcome

The model proved that a vehicle with a higher upfront cost could often be the better financial decision when adjusted for lower depreciation and maintenance costs.
